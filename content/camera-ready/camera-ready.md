## Camera-ready papers due: 25 August 2023 (11:59PM UTC-12:00 - “anywhere on Earth”).

### Formatting

Please use the official [RANLP 2023 Templates](http://ranlp.org/ranlp2023/index.php/submissions/), which are available as an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-ranlp-2023-proceedings/dwjrqsgfrrgm) template and also downloadable directly ([Latex](http://ranlp.org/ranlp2023/Templates/ranlp2023-LaTeX.zip) and [Word](http://ranlp.org/ranlp2023/Templates/ranlp2023-word.docx)). Authors should not modify these style files or use templates designed for other conferences.

### Length

Final versions are given one additional page of content so that reviewer's comments can be taken into account. So, **long papers** can have up to 9 pages while **short papers** can have up to 5 pages of content. 
Unlimited pages are given for references.
Appendices must appear right after the References.

### Extra Space for Lay Summary

For this edition of TSAR we are requesting authors of accepted papers to include a **lay summary** of their paper in the camera-ready version.
This lay summary should not be more than 400 words. Some guidelines on how to write a lay summary can be found [here](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/85518309/plain-language-summaries-how-to-write-an-elife-digest). 
Extra space is allowed after the 9th page (5th page for short papers) for a lay summary section.
This section should be titled **Lay Summary** and appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references.
